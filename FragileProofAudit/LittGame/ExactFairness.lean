# LittGame M4 — Exact fairness (`ExactFairness.lean`)

Transcription of Basdevant et al., "On cases where Litt's game is fair"
(arXiv:2406.20049v2), Theorem (bijection):

If `θ_AA = θ_BB` (equal autocorrelations), then for every `n`,
`P(Alice wins) = P(Bob wins)`.

## Proof plan (Basdevant et al.)

1. **Overlaps**: Words `Y = C_1^{m_1} C_2 ... ^{m_{k-1}} C_k` where `C_i ∈ {A,B}`
   and `m_i ∈ Cor(C_i, C_{i+1})`. (`overlapConcat` implements `C^m D`.)
2. **φ on overlaps**: `φ(Y) = C̄_k^{m_{k-1}} ... ^{m_1} C̄_1`
   (reverse order, swap A↔B). (`phiBlocks` implements the block reversal.)
   - Well-defined: needs `Cor(A,A) = Cor(B,B)` to ensure
     `m ∈ Cor(C_i, C_{i+1}) → m ∈ Cor(C̄_{i+1}, C̄_i)`.
   - Involution, preserves length, swaps `(N_A, N_B)`.
3. **Pattern decomposition**: Every word `Y` writes uniquely as
   `X_0 E_1 X_1 ... E_k X_k` with `E_i` overlaps and `X_i` containing no A/B.
4. **Key lemma**: `L_M(n) = L_{φ(M)}(n)` (pattern counts preserved).
5. **Main theorem**: The bijection swaps scores, so
   `winEvent` ↔ `loseEvent` bijectively, giving equal probabilities.

## Status

Definitions (`overlapConcat`, `swapAB'`, `phiBlocks`) are in place and build.
The proofs (well-definedness, involution, count-swapping, pattern decomposition,
main theorem) remain. This is the 2–4 week estimate from the workplan.

## M4 core lemmas (proved 2026-10-05)

Transcription of Basdevant et al. arXiv:2406.20049v2, Proposition 1
(well-definedness of φ) and the `θ`/`Cor` bridge.

The repo's `overlapSet q U V` is the paper's `Cor(U,V)` (overlap lengths
`1 ≤ k ≤ |U|-1` with matching suffix/prefix), restricted here to equal-length
words. "Same auto-correlation" (`Cor(A) = Cor(B)`) is `overlapSet q A A =
overlapSet q B B`; equal `θ` values imply it by base-`q` uniqueness of the
power sum (needs `2 ≤ q` and `|A| = |B|`).
